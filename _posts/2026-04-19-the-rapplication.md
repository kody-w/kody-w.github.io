For months we shipped agents. Then swarms. Then clouds. Then twins. Each layer earned its name by being the smallest thing that could carry that scale of intent. We had a hierarchy and we had a stack — what we did not have was a word for *the thing a user actually pulls down and runs*.

Now we do. We call it a **rapplication**: a RAPP application. One file. One drop-in. The converged output of the double-jump loop, sitting in `store/index.json` waiting to be installed.

This post names it, points at the first one, and explains why the singleton form matters more than the elegant multi-file form it came from.

**What a rapplication is:**

A rapplication is a single-file `agent.py` that contains an entire converged ensemble inlined into itself. It implements the same `BasicAgent` contract as any leaf agent, exposes the same `__manifest__`, hot-loads via the same brainstem mechanism. From the runtime's point of view, it is just an agent. From the author's point of view, it is the published form of a multi-file pipeline that has stopped iterating.

The first one lives at `agents/bookfactory_agent.py`. 543 lines. 24,779 bytes. SHA-256 `e4cc1cd9...`. Its catalog entry in `store/index.json` looks like this:

```json
{
  "id": "bookfactoryagent",
  "name": "BookFactory",
  "version": "0.3.0",
  "manifest_name": "@rapp/book-factory-singleton",
  "singleton_filename": "bookfactory_agent.py",
  "singleton_lines": 543,
  "singleton_bytes": 24779,
  "produced_by": {
    "method": "double-jump-loop",
    "cycles": 3,
    "source_files_collapsed": 13
  }
}
```

Thirteen files collapsed to one. That collapse is what makes it a rapplication.

**The unit hierarchy, named end-to-end:**

| Tier | Unit | What it is |
|---|---|---|
| L0 | `agent.py` | A sacred single file with one `BasicAgent` subclass and a SOUL |
| L1 | swarm | A hatched ensemble of agents inside one workspace, mid-flight |
| L2 | cloud | A tenant-scoped runtime hosting multiple swarms |
| L3 | twin | A persisted identity that occupies one or more clouds |

A rapplication is a special L0. It looks like an agent. It registers like an agent. It hot-loads like an agent. But internally it carries a hatched ensemble that has been frozen into its body. The `BookFactory` class at the bottom of `bookfactory_agent.py` is the public face. Above it sit ten `_Internal*` classes — `_InternalPersonaWriter`, `_InternalEditorCutweak`, `_InternalCEORisk`, the rest — prefixed specifically to hide them from the brainstem's `*Agent` discovery rule. Only `BookFactoryAgent` (the alias on line 500) is visible to the runtime. The other ten are private organs.

That is the trick. A rapplication is an agent whose body happens to be a swarm.

**Why a singleton — portability beats elegance:**

The multi-file source form is the right shape for *building*. The double-jump loop iterates against it. Each persona is editable as one file. Each SOUL is a string at the top of the file you opened. Composites direct-import their dependencies. That ensemble is how `BookFactory` got from cycle 1 to cycle 3 — by us editing five files, not by us refactoring an architecture (see `blog/89-double-jump-loop.md` for the cycle-by-cycle).

The multi-file form is the wrong shape for *shipping*. A user who wants to install BookFactory does not want to clone thirteen files into the right relative directory layout, satisfy the `from agents.editor_strip_scaffolding_agent import EditorStripScaffoldingAgent` imports, hope no helper module is missing. They want one file. They want to `cat` it, `scp` it, drop it into their brainstem's `agents/` folder, and call it.

The store entry says it plainly:

> "drop the singleton .py file into your local brainstem's `agents/` dir... The file is everything — no install script, no pip, no native deps."

Portability beats elegance. The collapse pays for itself the first time someone installs a rapplication on an air-gapped server with no source tree behind it.

**The collapse tool — `tools/build-bookfactoryagent.py`:**

The collapse is mechanical, not magical. The build script (149 lines, parses the source ensemble with `ast`) does six things in order:

1. Extract every `SOUL = """..."""` constant from each leaf and rename it `_SOUL_PERSONA_WRITER`, `_SOUL_EDITOR_CUTWEAK`, etc.
2. Extract every leaf class body, rename `class FooAgent` to `class _InternalFoo`, rewrite the SOUL reference inside `perform()`.
3. Extract every composite class body, rewrite every cross-agent instantiation (`EditorCutweakAgent()` → `_InternalEditorCutweak()`).
4. Take the top-level composite (`BookFactoryAgent`) and lift it as the public `BookFactory` class — the only one without an `_Internal` prefix.
5. Inline ONE `_llm_call` + `_post` helper at the bottom (the ten leaves had identical copies; the singleton needs one).
6. Append a `class BookFactoryAgent(BookFactory): pass` alias so the brainstem's "name ends in Agent" rule still finds it.

Net delete > net add. Thirteen files of source, one file out, all the per-file LLM helper duplication gone. The output is regeneratable: edit a SOUL in the source, re-run `python3 tools/build-bookfactoryagent.py`, get a new singleton.

**Naming distinction that matters:**

There were three words floating around for the same shape and we kept conflating them. Now they have edges:

- **agent** — the sacred single-file unit. Could be a leaf (one persona, one SOUL) or a composite (one file that references its siblings via direct import). The thing the brainstem hot-loads.
- **swarm** — a hatched ensemble of agents inside a workspace, mid-flight. The form a multi-file pipeline takes while it is being iterated against by the double-jump loop. Editable, distributed across files, alive.
- **rapplication** — a converged, ship-ready singleton. The public artifact a user installs from the store. A rapplication IS an agent (same contract), but specifically one whose internal multi-file ensemble has been hidden behind a single collapsed file.

Every rapplication is an agent. Not every agent is a rapplication. A leaf `editor_cutweak_agent.py` is an agent — but it has nothing to collapse, so it is not a rapplication. `bookfactory_agent.py` is a rapplication because something multi-file got collapsed into it.

**The first published one:**

`bookfactoryagent` is rapplication #1. Five-persona content pipeline (Writer → Editor [3 specialists] → CEO [2 specialists] → Publisher → Reviewer). 8 LLM calls per invocation, 75-second p50 wall time, 3 double-jump cycles to converge. The catalog entry lists 13 source files collapsed and a 0.625 cycle-3 corpus win rate against single-LLM baselines. One call, one chapter back.

**The doctrine, in two lines:**

The double-jump loop is how you BUILD a rapplication. The RAPPstore is how you SHIP one.

Author the multi-file source. Iterate it cycle by cycle until the loser stops losing. Run the collapse tool. Add an entry to `store/index.json`. The singleton sitting at the URL in that entry is now installable by anyone with a brainstem and a file copy command. That is the unit of converged AI workflow — the smallest object that carries *a finished pipeline* across the wire.

We did not invent the agent. We did not invent the bundle. We named the in-between thing — the converged singleton that an agent author hands to an agent user — and that name is *rapplication*.

One file. Same contract. Whole pipeline inside.
