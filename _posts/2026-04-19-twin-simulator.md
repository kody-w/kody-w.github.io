We deployed two twins to Azure Functions yesterday. Each in its own resource group, each with its own URL, each isolated. It worked. It cost real money (well — pennies). It took 5 minutes per twin.

Then we asked: *what if you could just do this locally? Same isolation, same per-twin endpoints, same T2T protocol, no cloud?*

That's the **RAPP Twin Simulator**. It's `hippocampus/twin-sim.sh` — a 200-line shell script that gives you the full Twin Stack ecosystem on one machine.

**One twin per directory + port:**

```bash
$ bash hippocampus/twin-sim.sh start kody
✓ Twin 'kody' running on http://127.0.0.1:7142 (workspace: ~/.rapp-twins/kody)

$ bash hippocampus/twin-sim.sh start molly
✓ Twin 'molly' running on http://127.0.0.1:7094 (workspace: ~/.rapp-twins/molly)
```

The port is deterministic — `7090 + hash(name) % 100`. Same name always gets the same port across reboots. So `~/.rapp-twins/kody/` is *Kody's twin*, full stop. Same workspace, same identity, same hatched swarms across sessions.

**Workspaces look like cloud RGs but on your filesystem:**

```
~/.rapp-twins/kody/
  workspace.json           name, port, created_at, url
  swarms/<guid>/...        each hatched cloud
  t2t/identity.json        cloud_id + secret + handle
  t2t/peers.json           whitelisted peer twins
  t2t/conversations/...    HMAC-verified chat logs
  documents/               twin-owned documents
  inbox/                   docs received from peers (sender-prefixed)
  outbox/                  audit trail of sent docs
  server.log
  server.pid
```

That's the same shape that `BRAINSTEM_HOME` points to in the deployed Function App. Move a workspace dir to a cloud blob mount → instant graduation. The simulator and the cloud share their entire data layout.

**Mutual peering in one command:**

```bash
$ bash hippocampus/twin-sim.sh peer kody molly
✓ Mutual T2T peering: @kody.local ↔ @molly.local
  Now twins can chat, share docs, and invoke each other's swarms.
```

The script reads each twin's identity.json directly from disk and hits both `/api/t2t/peers` endpoints with the OOB-exchanged secrets. Out-of-band exchange is "I have file access to both directories" — the strongest possible OOB channel.

**What this unlocks:**

- **Test multi-twin scenarios** without cloud spend. Boot 5 twins, run a synthetic C-suite committee.
- **Develop the T2T protocol** without two devices. localhost ports stand in for cross-device endpoints — same wire format.
- **Demo to investors** offline. The hero demo runs on a plane.
- **Fork your own twin** — `start kody-experiment`, peer it to the original, snapshot before risky soul edits.
- **Prove the data layout** before committing to cloud storage. If a workspace dir works locally, it works in Azure Files.

**The pattern matters more than the script:**

The lesson is *the cloud topology is reproducible at the filesystem level*. A "cloud twin" is a directory with conventions. The conventions are public, the directory layout is filesystem-native, the protocol between twins is HMAC over HTTP. There's nothing magical about Azure Functions — Azure Functions just gives you a publicly-reachable port pointed at a directory. The simulator gives you the same port + directory locally.

When the question becomes *"do we deploy this to the cloud?"* the answer is no longer "first we figure out the cloud architecture." The answer is "we move the directory."
